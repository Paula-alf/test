&nbsp; Last summer maybe, at school, I first tried **Vim editor** for the first time. At first, 
I was so uncomfortable with the key mapping of Vim, but by the time that the final test was coming up, I had totally gotten used to it. Now I think that learning Vim key mapping is very helpful in terms of productivity.
Although this might not be a good information for everyone with  so many well developed text editors these days, i just want to share my **.vimrc** file settings that I am currently using without such a big  issue.

### .vimrc
&nbsp;Paste the following into the file **~/.vimrc** to make the settings work.  
If the .vimrc file does not exist, create a .vimrc file in your **~/ ** directory

```viml
" syntax hilight 
syntax on 

set nocompatible

" search result hilight 
set hlsearch 

" line number 
set nu 

" auto indent 
set autoindent 

set scrolloff=2 
set wildmode=longest,list 

" tag select 
set ts=4 

" st select 
set sts=4 

" scroll bar width
set sw=1 

" automatically save when moving to another file 
set autowrite 

" automatically re-load if current file has been changed externally 
set autoread 

" C style indent 
set cindent 

set history=100

" always show status bar  
set laststatus=2 

" indent width (4 = 4 spaces)
set shiftwidth=4 

set smarttab
set smartindent
set softtabstop=4
set tabstop=4

" show the current cursor 
set ruler 

set statusline=\ %<%l:%v\ [%P]%=%a\ %h%m%r\ %F\

" file encoding 
set fileencoding=utf-8 

" when press backspace at line end, start or indent, move to previous line 
set backspace=eol,start,indent 

" incremental searching 
set incsearch 

" ignore case, set ic also works 
set ignorecase 

" terminal encoding 
set tenc=utf-8      

" korean files to euc-kr, uni-code to uni-code 
set fencs=ucs-bom,utf-8,euc-kr.latin1 

" key mappings Leader key 
let mapleader=","

" allow use mouse 
" F7 to turn it on
map <F7> <ESC>:set mouse=a<CR>
" F8 to turn it off
map <F8> <ESC>:set mouse-=a<CR>

" key mappings 
" insert mode
inoremap jk <esc>

" normal mode
nnoremap <S-l> $
nnoremap <S-h> ^
nnoremap d<S-l> d$
nnoremap d<S-h> d^
nnoremap <Tab> >>
nnoremap <S-Tab> <<
nnoremap <C-k> :m--<CR>==
nnoremap <C-j> :m +1<CR>==
nnoremap <S-k> k

" to avoid openning help when pressed Shift-k
nnoremap <leader>h <S-k>

" visual mode
vnoremap <S-l> $
vnoremap <S-h> ^
```
