&nbsp; In my previous post, I dealed with **[Jekyll Install on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://jerry901.github.io/en/2020/01/2020-01-26-02/)**.
Today, let's take a look at how to publish Gihub pages with **Jekyll**

## Create a new Github Repository 

&nbsp; First of all, You need to **[create a new Github repository](http://www.github.com/new)** to upload your pages created by Jekyll. The repository name should be formatted as **username.github.io**. Tnen, this will work as the domain name of your site.

## $ git clone Jekyll-theme
&nbsp; Secondly, **[Pick a theme here](http://jekyllthemes.org)** that you might want to use for your bolg. 
What i picked was **[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)** theme which is one of the most popular Jekyll themes; 
~~this bolg was also built with Minimal Mis..~~. Run the commad below to install Minimal Mistakes theme. 
If you chose another theme for your site, change the URL in **git clone** command to the URL of the repository that you picked.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git
$ cd minimal-mistakes
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
If you see the messages below, you are all set.
```bash
Configuration file: /home/userName/minimal-mistakes/_config.yml
            Source: /home/userName/minimal-mistakes
       Destination: /home/userName/minimal-mistakes/_site
 Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental

                    done in 0.199 seconds.
 Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/home/userName/minimal-mistakes'
    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
    Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```
&nbsp; Check if your local server works and if the theme that you picked has successfully applied to your site by going to 
**[http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)** or **[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)**.  


## $ git clone Repository
&nbsp; Clone your **```userName.github.io```** repository, and copy the files in minimal-mistakes directory to the local repositroy. 
Then, your source will be automatically built by Github and published.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone repo_URL 
$ cp -r minimal-mistakes/* local_repo_folder_name
$ cd local_repo_folder_name
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "hello my blog"
$ git push origin master 
```
Go to **```https://userName.github.io```** and see your new blog!. It takes few munites to be able to see the published pages.
