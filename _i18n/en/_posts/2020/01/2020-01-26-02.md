&nbsp;I have long thought of publishing Github pages about development knowledge and have tried a lot, 
but I gave up every time on organizing the development environment. 
The most common environment for this is to use **Jekyll** platform on macOS. 
However, It is too expensive to buy a MacBook only to create a blog, so today, 
I am going to provide you with guided steps on how to install a static site generator called **Jekyll** on a **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** environment.

## Installing Ruby 
&nbsp;Jekyll is written in Ruby language, so you must install the Ruby before installing it. 
You can simply install the Ruby with the Package manager "apt" (**homebrew** in case of MacOS). However, this can get u into a such deep trouble because each software written in Ruby(a.k.a **gems**) has different version of Ruby to be installed with.
Therefore, we will install the Ruby using one of the Ruby version management softwares called **rbenv** 

### - Run command "apt-get update" and install all the dependencies 
 Run these commands, The command **apt-get update** will do nothing but update the list of softwares that your system may need.
```bash
 $ sudo apt-get update
 $ sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev software-properties-common libffi-dev nodejs
 ```
 
### - Installing rbenv
```bash
 $ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

### - Adding environment variables for Ruby
&nbsp;if check your ~/.bashrc file after running these commands, you would be able to see these variables added to **.bashrc**
```bash
 $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
 $ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
 $ exec $SHELL
 ```
 
### - Installing ruby-build 
```bash
 $ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
 $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
 $ exec $SHELL
 ```
 
### - Rehashing rbenv
 &nbsp;rbenv creates shims for all the commands ( ruby , irb , rake , gem and so on) across all your installed versions of Ruby. This process is called rehashing. Every time you install a new version of Ruby or install a gem that provides a command, run rbenv rehash to make sure any new commands are shimmed.
```bash
 $ rbenv rehash
 ```
 
### - Installing Ruby with rbenv
&nbsp; The version of Ruby thay i'm using is 2.6.3 and i haven't had any issues with it, but you can definately choose the version depending on your preference
```bash
 $ rbenv install 2.6.3 
 $ rbenv global 2.6.3 
 $ rbenv rehash 
 ```

### - Installing Jekyll 
&nbsp;If you install Ruby with rbenv, you would probably get **gem** installed together. 
**gem** is one of the gems that Ruby can install, so you can call this gem on you command line. **gem** command is used to install the other gems written in Ruby. This seems to me like it does the same thing as what **apt-get** command does on Linux.
```bash
 $ gem install jekyll
 ```
### - Installing bundler
&nbsp;What bundler does is managing each gem's application depndency. In case that a gem is dependant on the other gem, we can write these dependencies in a file called **Gemfile**, and install those gems easily with a command **bundle install**. 
```bash
 $ gem install bundler
```

## Now get started with Jekyll
### - Create a new Jekyll project
 &nbsp; After creating a new Jekyll project with **Jekyll new** command, we can run our project by running jekyll serve command. If you want to publish github pages, the format of your project folder's name must be **github_username.githubio**
```bash
 $ Jekyll new project_name  
 $ cd project_name
 ~/project_name $ jekyll serve
```
 
### - Example of Bundler usage
Move to your project's root directory, and then open **Gemfile**
 ```bash
 ~/project_name $ vi Gemfile
 ```
 Add a dependency like below (anywhere). jekyll_plugins allows us to work with graphical admin pages while we are working on our jekyll project.
 ```bash
 gem 'jekyll-admin', group: :jekyll_plugins
 ```
 Run bundle install command to install the plugin
 ```bash
 $ bundle install
 $ cd ~/project_name
  ~/project_name $ jekyll serve 
 ```
Now we can check if it works on http://localhost:4000/admin/
